# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs Through Geo-Spatial Analysis

**Overview:**

This project analyzes geospatial data of delivery routes and customer locations to identify and recommend strategies for optimizing last-mile delivery costs.  The analysis aims to reduce these costs by at least 15% within the next quarter. This is achieved through the application of various geospatial analysis techniques to identify inefficiencies in current routing and delivery processes.  The project outputs actionable recommendations for route optimization and cost reduction.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* [Add other libraries as needed, e.g., Geopandas, Scikit-learn]


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the analysis:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key findings such as:

* Initial total delivery cost.
* Identified areas of inefficiency in current routes.
* Estimated cost savings after implementing recommended optimizations.
* Specific route adjustments suggested for improved efficiency.

Additionally, the script will generate several plot files (e.g., `route_optimization_map.png`, `cost_savings_comparison.png`) visualizing the current and optimized delivery routes, and the projected cost savings.  These plots provide a visual representation of the analysis and its conclusions.
